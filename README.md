# Employee-payroll-system
An employee payroll system based on Java OOP concepts would include classes such as Employee, Payroll, and PayrollSystem.

1. *Employee Class*: Contains attributes like employee ID, name, position, department, hourly rate or salary, and any additional information.
2. *Payroll Class*: Manages the calculation of payments for each employee based on their pay structure (hourly or salary), overtime, bonuses, deductions, and taxes.
3. *PayrollSystem Class*: Handles the overall management of the payroll system including adding new employees, updating employee information, processing payroll for each pay period, generating pay stubs or reports, and managing tax deductions and withholdings.

The system would involve methods like calculating pay, updating employee information, generating pay reports.
